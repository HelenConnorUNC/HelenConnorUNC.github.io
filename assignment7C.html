People first ventured into the area as the glaciers receeded. By the times the first Europeans arraived, tribes such as the Shoshone, Bannock, Blackfoot, Crow, Flathead, Gros Ventre, Nez Perce and others were occupying the valley and harvesting its seasonal riches. <br><br>European-American exploration began in the early 19th century, with fur trappers and explorers like John Colter venturing into the Teton Range. The Lewis and Clark Expedition, in 1807-1808, provided some of the first detailed descriptions of the region. <br><br>In 1929, President Calvin Coolidge designated the area as Jackson Hole National Monument, preserving it for future generations. In 1950, the monument was folded into Grand Teton National Park, officially established to protect the spectacular Teton Range and its surrounding ecosystem.</div>
